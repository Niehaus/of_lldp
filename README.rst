Overview

The *of_lldp* application implements the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP).

############
How it Works
############

In order to track connections between switches under the present SDN
controller, this NAPP uses the LLDP protocol with the following procedure:

1. Periodically this NApp builds and sends a PacketOut OpenFlow message
   containing the Ethernet Packet with LLDP data to forward any LLDP.
   This LLDP packet is designed to the specific switch and port related to the
   PacketOut, by carrying the switch DPID and the Port that it will be forwarded
   to.

2. The switches forward the packet throught the given Port and, if another
   switch is connected to that port, it won't know how to handle the Ethernet
   packet that was forwarded. So, it will send a ``PacketIn`` with that
   Ethernet packet to the controller.

3. This NApp will get all ``PacketIn`` messages and look for Ethernet packets
   with LLDP content. If it is one of the LLDP packets generated by the NApp,
   than it will get the information from the ``PacketIn`` (switch/dpid and
   in_port).

4. At last but not least, the NApp will generate a KytosEvent with the
   'source-destination' information.

This protocol is vendor free and used to discover network devices and all links
between them. This protocol is implemented at layer 2 (L2) and defined in the
IEEE 802.1ab. A network management system (NMS) can rapidly obtain the L2
network topology and topology changes over time using LLDP.

Installing
##########

All of the Kytos Network Applications are located in the NApps online
repository. To install this NApp, run:

.. code:: shell

   $ kytos napps install kytos/of_lldp

######
Events
######

Listen
******

kytos/of_core.v0x0[14].messages.in.ofpt_packet_in
=================================================
Listen to any OpenFlow PacketIn in versions 1.0 (v0x01) or 1.3 (v0x04).

Generate
********

kytos/of_lldp.messages.out.ofpt_packet_out
===========================================

*buffer*: ``message_out``

Standard "message out" event with a PacketOut message to the switch containing
a LLDP packet inside it.

kytos/of_lldp.interface.is.nni
==============================
*buffer*: ``app``

An event to notify those interested that an interface was identified as a NNI
(network-to-network interface) interface. This is possible due to the fact that
a connection between two switches was identified. This does not mean that it is
a new connection, it may be an already known connection between two switches.
This event contains an attribute `switch` and another `port`, the first one
contains the switch id and the second one the port number.

Content
-------

The content of an event will have the following format:

.. code-block:: python3

   content = {'switch': switch.id, 'port': port_number}}
